# Red-Teamer

The Red-Teamer serves as a tool for navigating and annotating attack matrices, mirroring actions already taken in programs like Excel. Designed to be straightforward and versatile, it enables users to visualize defensive strategies, plan red/blue team activities, track the frequency of detected techniques, or any other desired task. The Red-Teamer facilitates manipulation of matrix cells, allowing for actions like color-coding, adding comments, or assigning numerical values without restrictions. Its simplicity aims to make utilizing attack more accessible.

A key feature of the Red-Teamer is its capability for users to create custom views, known as layers, of the attack knowledge base. These layers can focus on specific aspects, such as techniques relevant to a particular platform or those associated with a specific adversary. Users can generate layers interactively within the Red-Teamer or programmatically, then visualize them through the tool.
