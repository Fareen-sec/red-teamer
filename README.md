# Red-Teamer

The Red-Teamer serves as a tool for navigating and annotating attack matrices, mirroring actions already taken in programs like Excel. Designed to be straightforward and versatile, it enables users to visualize defensive strategies, plan red/blue team activities, track the frequency of detected techniques, or any other desired task. The Red-Teamer facilitates manipulation of matrix cells, allowing for actions like color-coding, adding comments, or assigning numerical values without restrictions. Its simplicity aims to make utilizing attack more accessible.

A key feature of the Red-Teamer is its capability for users to create custom views, known as layers, of the attack knowledge base. These layers can focus on specific aspects, such as techniques relevant to a particular platform or those associated with a specific adversary. Users can generate layers interactively within the Red-Teamer or programmatically, then visualize them through the tool.

To access the Red-Teamer, users can visit its live instance on GitHub Pages. Version 4.0 offers support for all attack domains within a single application instance, eliminating the need for separate instances for each domain. Additionally, it introduces support for the ICS domain. Users can load older attack versions, ranging from 4 to 8, into the application, expanding its compatibility while recognizing that versions older than 4 are incompatible due to significant changes in their data models.
